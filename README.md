# DevOps Project: Django Notes App Deployment with Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This project aims to automate the deployment process of a Django notes application on an EC2 instance using Jenkins declarative CI/CD pipeline. Leveraging Docker containers and Docker Hub for containerization and image management, the project focuses on automating the deployment process to ensure seamless integration and delivery of the application.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a robust and automated deployment solution for containerized applications, leveraging Jenkins as the orchestration engine and Docker for containerization. By automating the deployment process, the project aims to achieve the following objectives:
- Enhance efficiency in the deployment process.
- Reduce manual intervention and human errors.
- Establish a continuous deployment pipeline for rapid, consistent, and reliable delivery of containerized applications.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following components:
- **Django Notes App**: The application to be deployed. It is a Django-based web application for managing notes.
- **Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline**: Orchestrates the deployment process using a declarative pipeline defined in a Jenkinsfile.
- **Docker Containers**: Used for containerizing the Django Notes App and managing dependencies.
- **Docker Hub**: Used for hosting Docker images and facilitating image management.
- **EC2 Instance**: The target environment for deploying the Dockerized application.

## Prerequisites
Before running the deployment pipeline, ensure the following prerequisites are met:
- Access to an AWS account to provision EC2 instances.
- Docker installed on the Jenkins server.
- Jenkins installed and configured with necessary plugins.
- Proper permissions and access credentials for Docker Hub and AWS services.

## Deployment Process
1. **Cloning the Code**: The Jenkins pipeline starts by cloning the source code repository containing the Django Notes App from the specified branch.
2. **Building the Docker Image**: The Docker image for the Django Notes App is built using the `Dockerfile` provided in the repository. Any dependencies required by the application are included in the image.
3. **Pushing to Docker Hub**: Once the Docker image is built, it is tagged and pushed to Docker Hub repository specified in the Jenkins pipeline configuration. Proper authentication is performed using Docker credentials.
4. **Deploying the Container**: After the image is pushed to Docker Hub, the deployment process begins. This involves pulling the Docker image from Docker Hub onto the target EC2 instance and running it using Docker Compose.

## Usage
To use the CI/CD pipeline for deploying the Django Notes App:
1. Configure Jenkins with the provided Jenkinsfile and necessary credentials.
2. Trigger the pipeline manually or configure webhook-based triggers based on repository events.
3. Monitor the Jenkins pipeline execution for any errors or failures.
4. Access the deployed application on the target EC2 instance to verify successful deployment.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of automation in streamlining the deployment process of containerized applications using Jenkins CI/CD pipeline and Docker containers. By following the provided instructions, users can efficiently deploy the Django Notes App onto an EC2 instance, ensuring rapid and reliable delivery of the application.
